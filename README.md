# Random-Ceramic-Tile-Generator
When I went to Sava's in Ann Arbor I was blown away by the beauty of the ceramic tiles within the restaurant. I want to create a random ceramic tile generator, using Polar coordinates and other Math stuff. 

I will be graphing the Polar Graph's using the HTML5 Canvas. I will then make them exportable as a Web Component.
